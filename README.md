# Zordle: ZK Wordle

Zordle is [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), but with zero-knowledge proofs. Zordle uses ZK proofs to prove that a player knows words that map to their shared grid, but does not reveal those words to a verifier. Zordle is probably the first end-to-end web app built using [Halo 2](https://github.com/zcash/halo2/) ZK proofs!

This project was made as part of [0xPARC Halo 2 Learning Group](https://0xparc.org/blog/halo2-learning-group). Big shoutout to [Ying Tong](https://twitter.com/therealyingtong) for basically hand-holding me through Halo2 circuit writing and to [Uma](https://twitter.com/pumatheuma) and [Blaine](https://twitter.com/BlaineBublitz) for significant work on porting the Halo 2 library to WASM.

# Motivation and user flow

Earlier this year, Wordle became one of the most popular word games, with millions logging on every day to attempt the day's Wordle and share their successes with friends and social media. Wordle's popularity was primarily driven by a really simple to share grid:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6984346/178630626-65108409-9fbf-4f08-bca6-66b4fa426fff.png" width="32%" />

_At some point, my only form of communication with some of my friends was Wordle grid exchanges_

However, the ease of sharing these emoji boxes came with an unfortunate flaw: A player could just edit their grid after the game and make themselves seem much smarter than they originally were. I was always suspicious if my friends _really_ got the scores they claimed or not. ZK SNARKs to the rescue! ðŸ¤“

In Zordle, after solving the day's Wordle, a user additionally generates a ZK proof attesting that they know the set of words that perfectly correspond to a set of emoji boxes that they're sharing![^1]

[^1]: Ignore the minor technical detail that they can always just cheat by looking up the day's word elsewhere. ðŸ˜…

Learning about the shiny new features of Halo 2, Wordle seemed like a cool toy application to get my hands dirty with the library, so I chose to work on this as my learning group project! The rest of this README will be a technical note on the circuits and an informal introduction to the Halo 2 Library and features of PLONKish proving systems.

# Circuit

The over-simplified mental model of Halo 2 I've come to appreciate is that of a giant spreadsheet: You have cells in a tabular format you can fill values in, mutate them from cell to cell, and check that relationships and constraints you'd desire hold true. Additionally, you have access to some "global" structures that are more powerful than just plain cell relationship comparators: you can check row A is a permutation of row B for a very cheap cost, and its also very cheap to check set membership of the value of a particular cell in a giant list (as long as you can define said giant list at "compile time").

<img width="1187" alt="Muse MuseBoard 2022-07-13 11 37 57" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6984346/178774262-4e87557c-e66d-4d90-b3bd-94100bcafc49.png">


To be slightly more precise, Halo 2 essentially structures circuits as row-column operations: There are 4 primary types of columns:

- Instance columns: these are best associated with public inputs
- Advice columns: these are best associated with private inputs and the computation trace of the circuit, the "witness" and,
- Fixed columns: constants used in the computation, known at "compile time"
- Selector columns: these are binary values used to "select" particular advice and instance cells and define constraints between them.

Additionally, there's the notion of a lookup column that allows you to check set membership efficiently but that's perhaps best thought of as a giant fixed set instead of a circuit table column.

Of course, the natural question, given this abstraction, is to figure out what's the right way to write efficient ZK circuits inside this playground? Should I use more rows? Or more columns? The answer is quite complicated.

For simpler schemes like Groth16 that are based on R1CS, circuit engineers have universally accepted the metric of "the number of constraints" since most tasks associated with the ZK proof (compilation, proving time, trusted setup compute etc.) scale linearly with the number of non-linear constraints. The structure of PLONK circuits, on the other hand, allows for much more flexibility in defining a circuit, and with it comes a very tough to grasp cost model. There are some rough heuristics however, for instance, more rows make proving time slower (notably, however, the big jump in proving times occurs when number of rows cross powers of 2, where the cost of the intermediate polynomial FFTs required doubles) while more columns make verification time slower. Notably, also, Halo 2, the library, in fact, is very flexible and allows for instantiation of circuits using different polynomial commitment schemes (such as IPA and KZG) which makes cost-modelling instantiation dependent as well.

The abstraction of a spreadsheet for PLONKish arithmetisation is quite powerful because it allows the library to lay out and pack the rows and columns of your circuit tighter automatically (and paves the way for an IR/automated circuit optimiser long term). While great for optimizations, unfortunately this ability to auto-pack comes at the expense of making the API more nuanced and the cost modeling of circuits even more non-trivial to an end circuit programmer.

To elaborate on the _nuance_ of the API, Halo 2 defines the concept of a "region" inside the spreadsheet. A region is the minimal set of cells such that all constraints relating to any one of them is contained entirely within this region. This is a mouthful, but in essence regions are the minimal building blocks of a circuit. Typically, non-ZK apps are written in disparate modules - a good analogy for this is perhaps the Clock app on your mobile phone: the app is structured coherently to a user (around "time") but if you think about it like a programmer, the timer tab has very little in common with the world clock tab. The same is true for ZK circuits, a Clock circuit might want to check both the world clock and the status of a timer, and the representation of each of these is its own "region" in the Clock circuit. A programmer will write both of them almost independently, and let the compiler figure out the best way to "pack" them into the spreadsheet.

_Coherency of "time" to a user, but incoherency of regions to a programmer_

While cost-modelling seems to be quite problematic for circuit writers on the surface with the Halo 2 library set up right now, the general read of participants in the Halo 2 Learning Group seems to be that these APIs give circuit writers enough breathing room to hyper-optimise computation for commonly used primitive circuits, and in future, these efficient primitives can be composed (perhaps inefficiently) into real apps by higher-level circuit writers. Hopefully, eventually, ZK circuits will get to a point where few low-level programmers will hyper-optimise a minimal instruction set, and the rest of us will just roll our circuits into compilers composing and optimising circuits on those instruction sets.[^2]

[^2]: Supposedly, this will also mark the switching point where we can stop bothering with a hyper-optimised zkEVMs and instead just write a zkMIPS machine for all VMs. More notes on this tradeoff [here](https://kelvinfichter.com/pages/thoughts/hybrid-rollups/).

It's certainly fun to theorise about the future of ZK circuit writing, but right now, we have a very real task at hand: making an anti-cheat that doesn't really work for a meaningless word game that's not even popular any more ðŸ¤¡. And the only way to write these circuits is delve into the weeds and think deeply about the spreadsheet and its regions and what-not as a "low-level" programmer.

First, let's quickly formalise our public/private inputs:

### Public inputs

- The solution word
- The grid of boxes of 6 words x 5 slots (one for each letter): each cell in the grid is either green, yellow or grey

### Private inputs

- 6 words of 5 letters each

The initial observation I had about Wordle's structure is that every guess is quite independent of the others - if a guess is valid on its own, its always valid inside a game and vice-versa. This made me think that the right structure is to make an individual region for each guess.

With this one region per guess abstraction, let's think about what checks are necessary for each guess:

- It must be a english word of 5 letters
- It must be that if the grid box corresponding to a letter in the word is green, the letter at the corresponding spot must match the solution's letter
- If a grid box is _not_ green, the letter at the corresponding spot must _not_ match
- Similar checks if grid box is yellow (and if its not yellow)

### English word

Typically, in a R1CS circuit, you would make the check for a guess being a dictionary word a Merkle proof. You would make a Merkle tree of all the words in the dictionary and witness the Merkle path of your guess in the tree[^3]. In PLONK/Halo 2 however, you have the added ability of lookup tables! While it's not particularly efficient to use lookup tables this way (since your circuit now has 12000+ rows), its a cool way to make use of the lookup table feature.

[^3]: Alternately, [you can tightly pack polynomial hashes of words in field elements ðŸ¥²](https://github.com/nalinbhardwaj/wordlines)

### Green

Precisely, this check is: for each slot of the grid, if the slot is green, compare the letters at that slot in the guess and the solution. They should be equal.

### Not green

This check is: for each slot of the grid, if the slot is _not_ green, compare the letters at that slot in the guess and the solution. They should _not_ be equal. In other words, the difference of the letters at that slot should be non-zero. We'll use this reformulation later.

### Yellow and not yellow

The check for yellow color work almost the same way: Instead of comparing the letters at the exact slot, the comparison is just replaced by a giant OR on all possible pairings of the guess letter with letters of the solution.

Let's ignore the yellow color boxes for now and just try to lay the intermediate variables out in one region of the spreadsheet, considering only the green boxes:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6984346/178804579-436cf1ca-c4c3-488f-8743-95ad4cd93473.png)

Consider the witness trace of this circuit: We start with the guess (the first row) and the final solution (the second row) and go through a few intermediate computations to obtain the expected value of green boxes. `diff_green`, the third row, is the difference between the letters at the corresponding slots of the solution and the guess (for instance, slot 2, "U" - "L" = 9). Next, to do the two aforementioned green checks, we need to know 

Now that we have a high level intuition for what our circuit should "do", let's figure out how to actually _code_ this with Halo 2.

# API

Fundamentally, the Halo 2 API is a way to write functions (or formulas if you will) on the abstraction of the underlying spreadsheet data structure. Since we can't populate each cell and hand wire each constraint by hand, we need a programmatic layer to do this for us.

The Halo 2 library splits this circuit programming into a 2 pass structure: in the first pass, you decide on and assign all the constraints and logical gates that each region/row/cell must abide by. The second pass is assignment/witness generation: you populate values into this spreadsheet and "instantiate" it.[^4]

While I've already mentioned some details of the idea of regions before, a lot of the Halo 2 library is the wrapping of these regions into tight APIs that reduce programmer overhead. Besides regions that act as locality constructions in the spreadsheet, another accompanying concept introduced by the Halo 2 API is that of **rotation**. Imagine that you are *processing* the spreadsheet row by row, top to bottom. The rotation is just a way to express a row relative to the current row. So the current row is the current "rotation" in this sequential process, the row just above is the "-1" (or "previous") rotation and so on and so forth.




Some other miscellanous notes/thoughts about the Halo 2 API I couldn't fit elsewhere:

- One quirk of the Halo 2 API is that while advice columns are referred to by offset rotations, the instance columns are referred to by absolute row numbers, which adds to some confusion. But this is mostly a function of these instance columns being entirely independent of the regions abstraction.
- Note that the spreadsheet model of layouting is a very intentional choice of the Halo 2 Library. There are many other ways to model ZK circuits while still using them with PLONKish arithmetisation. For instance, Yi Sun/Jonathan Wang from the learning group used only a single column to write their circuit (the [halo2wrong](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/halo2wrong/blob/master/ecdsa/src/ecdsa.rs) repo does something similar) primarily to reduce verification cost and simplify cost-modelling. On the other hand, Circom developers are planning to stick to the R1CS-like circuit layout structure but just add the ability to define [custom gates](https://github.com/iden3/circom/pull/67) using PLONK. Ultimately, I personally think the generalised many-row many-column spreadsheet like structure is the most flexible representation amongst these, but there's definitely tradeoffs in ease-of-use vs powerfulness to be explored.
- I love the detail and care put into debug info for the Halo 2 library. Coming from circom-land (where debugging detail is _quite_ lacking to say the least), Halo 2's debugging hand-holding was a breath of fresh air. :)) And I love the little parrot! ðŸ¦œ

[^4]: Sidenote that soundness/under-constraining bugs in this Halo 2 model essentially lie at the margin of the difference of these two passes. This is a useful fact to keep in mind as a circuit writer.
